Data have been taken by the github repository produced and described in the article:
"Multiscale dynamic human mobility flow dataset in the U.S. during the COVID-19 epidemic" ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00734-5#Sec7 )

I've collected the weekly flow datasets of march and april 2020 (during the first pandemic surge) for county e for census tracts.
