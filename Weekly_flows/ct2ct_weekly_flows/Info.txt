In this repository there is the R script to build up the txt files that will be the input commuting files for the SIR model modified
at NYC's ZCTAs level. 
Data on population per ZCTA have been taken from the Azure repository Open Datasets
(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/open-datasets/catalog/us-decennial-census-zip/)
Data were about all US ZCTAs so the dataset has been clean from all unimortant informations.
These data have been used to create the input txt file for the population at zcta level
and to check also that the computed traffic out from a single zcta isn't higher then the total population 
at zcta level during the 10 weeks considered for the variations of the commuting pattern.

Moreover, the data for commuting at ZCTA level have been constructed using the data avaiable in the repository: 

https://github.com/GeoDS/COVID19USFlows -- from the materials of the paper: "Multiscale dynamic human mobility flow dataset in the U.S. during the COVID-19 epidemic" 

So, it has been necessary to use the geographic corrispondences between census tracts and ZCTA at geographic level, using the NYC zcta to geoid csv file:
this has been collected from https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/records-layout/2010-zcta-record-layout.html,
were 2010 ZCTA to County Relationship File Layout is avaiable.
